## üåü Features

- Automatically downloads packages from JSR
- Converts JSR package names to npm-compatible formats
- Updates package metadata for npm compatibility
- Publishes the converted package to npm
- Designed for use with GitHub Actions

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- GitHub repository
- npm account (for publishing)

## üöÄ Usage with GitHub Actions

To use `mirror-jsr-to-npm` in your GitHub Actions workflow, create a new workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/publish-to-npm.yml`) with the following content:

```yaml
name: Publish to npm

env:
  NODE_VERSION: lts/*
  DENO_VERSION: v1.x

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  jsr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: denoland/setup-deno@v1
        with:
          deno-version: ${{ env.DENO_VERSION }}
      - name: Publish to jsr
        run: deno publish

  npm:
    needs: 
      - jsr
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # if you need publish with provenance, you should set permissions
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org' # needed for npm publish
      - uses: denoland/setup-deno@v1
        with:
          deno-version: ${{ env.DENO_VERSION }}
      - name: Publish to npm
        run: deno run -A jsr:@ryoppippi/mirror-jsr-to-npm
        env:
          PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION: "Your package description"
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }} # Set your npm token as a GitHub secret
          NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE: true # If you publish with provenance
```

Make sure to replace `@your-scope/your-package`, "Your package description", and "https://your-homepage.com" with your actual package details.

## üîë Environment Variables

- `PACKAGE_NAME`: The name of your package (e.g., "@octocat/hello-world")
- `PACKAGE_VERSION`: The version of your package (optional, defaults to the git tag)
- `PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION`: A brief description of your package
- `PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE`: The homepage URL of your package (optional, default is jsr page)
- `PACKAGE_REPOSITORY`: The URL of your package's repository (optional, defaults to `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`)
- `PACKAGE_LICENSE`: The license of your package (optional, defaults to "MIT")
- `PACKAGE_AUTHOR`: The author of the package (optional, defaults to `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER`)
- `NPM_TOKEN`: Your npm authentication token (should be set as a GitHub secret)
- `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE`: Whether to publish with provenance (optional, defaults to false)
- `NPM_OPTIONS`: Additional options for npm publish command (optional, defaults to `--access public`)

## üîß How It Works

1. Triggered by a new release in your GitHub repository
2. Downloads the specified package from JSR
3. Modifies the `package.json` to be compatible with npm:
   - Updates the package name
   - Sets the description, homepage, repository, license, and author based on provided environment variables or GitHub-provided information
4. Publishes the modified package to npm
